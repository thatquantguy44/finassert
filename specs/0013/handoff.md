### 2026-11-13 — Gate 5: Atomic Excel reports and complete CLI file workflow

- **Branch / PR:** `feature/seven-priority-roadmap`, [draft PR #17](https://github.com/thatquantguy44/finassert/pull/17).
- **Done:** Atomic Excel reports and complete CLI file workflow.
- **Evidence:** 200 workbook, CLI, loader, and strict-policy tests passed; Ruff, mypy, and strict documentation build passed.
- **Next step:** Gate 6: typed money and ratios plus direct FX provenance.

### 2026-11-13 — Gate 2: Adapter length enforcement and shared contracts

- **Branch / PR:** `feature/seven-priority-roadmap`, [draft PR #17](https://github.com/thatquantguy44/finassert/pull/17).
- **Done:** Adapter length enforcement and shared contracts.
- **Evidence:** 86 adapter tests passed across six input forms, including generated workbook/pandas equivalence; Ruff and mypy passed.
- **Next step:** Gate 3: bounded diagnostics and strict artifacts.

### 2026-11-13 — Gate 1: Excel formula and error-cell correctness

- **Branch / PR:** `feature/seven-priority-roadmap`, [draft PR #17](https://github.com/thatquantguy44/finassert/pull/17).
- **Done:** Excel formula and error-cell correctness.
- **Evidence:** 86 focused Excel tests, Ruff, and mypy passed; six regressions failed before the fix.
- **Next step:** Gate 2: enforce adapter lengths and shared contracts.

### 2026-11-13 — Numbered spec workspace created

- **Branch:** `docs/spec-0011-excel`.
- **Done:** Moved the original spec verbatim from
  `specs/0011-excel-workbook-integration.md` to `spec.md`; added plan, task, roadmap,
  contract, agent, and handoff files.
- **Not done / partial:** Runtime implementation and existing spec status are unchanged.
  Open tasks are not claimed complete.
- **Decisions:** Requirements remain canonical in `spec.md`; companion files track
  execution and evidence. Earlier project history remains in the [master
  handoff](../../docs/handoff.md).
- **Verify with:** Use [plan.md](plan.md) for baseline checks; documentation migration
  checks are recorded in the master handoff.
- **Next step:** Start with the first unchecked item in [tasks.md](tasks.md).
